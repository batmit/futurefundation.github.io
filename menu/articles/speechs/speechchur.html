        <h1>"We Shall fight on the beaches" </h1>
        <h3>Winston Churchill Speech</h3>


        <p>The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend together to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good conrades to the utmost of their strenght.</p>

        <p>Even though larg tracts of Europe and many old famous states have fallen ou may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi Rule, we shall not flag or fail.</p>

        <p>We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strenght in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which i do not for a moment belive, this Island or a large part of it were subjulgated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God good yime, the New World, with all his power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the Old.</p>
